# Machine-Learning-on-Kubernetes

Overview:
This project involves deploying a Machine Learning application using Docker containers and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The steps include building and running the app locally using Docker, pushing the image to Docker Hub, and deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster created in Google Cloud.

Step 1: Set up a Kubernetes Cluster
Step 2: Machine Learning Deployment using Docker
    Build Docker Image
    Run Docker Container
    Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
    Stop Docker Container

Step 3: Deploy ML App to GKE
    Create Kubernetes Deployment
    Create Kubernetes Service
    Access the Application

Conclusion:
This project covers setting up a machine learning app with Flask in a Docker container and deploying it to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The steps include creating a Kubernetes cluster, building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying the application on GKE using Kubernetes deployment and service configurations. The application can be accessed via the browser using the external IP provided by the LoadBalancer service.
